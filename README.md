# Really simple N:N videoconferencing using WebRTC

 Multi-user videoconference prototype using WebRTC and plain JS and HTML. For signalling, it uses Node.js and all multimedia streams are sent directly between users (P2P) after signalling process is finished.
 
Demo [here!](https://multiuser-videochat-webrtc.herokuapp.com/)

## Signalling
 
The signalling process was made based on [this amazing article of Borja Nebbal](https://acidtango.com/thelemoncrunch/how-to-implement-a-video-conference-with-webrtc-and-node/) and adapted for N:N communications. The messages used in this signalling process are shown in the picture below.

Just enter the code of your videoconference room and share that code, so others can join to the same room.
